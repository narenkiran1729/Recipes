![Final Dish](/Images/SujiHalwa/FinalDish.JPG)
This recipe is very simple and easy to make. The only thing is that it is little bit higher on cost due to nuts and ghee. As always you can skip the nuts if they are too costly for you to add.

**Other names of Suji :**

![Ingredients Card](/Images/SujiHalwa/IngredientsCard.JPG)
Suji : 1cup  
Water : 2cups(*double the amount of suji*)

Ghee : 1/2 cup(*half the quantity of suji*)  
Nuts(*Optional*) : Cashew, Badam, Kismis, Pista  
Ilachi : 2 pods (*crushed*)  
Salt : pinch (*Salt in sweet! Am I crazy? Pinch of salt(not more than that) enhances sweetness of the dish. Adding more salt spoils the dish. Plz be careful while adding salt*)  

## Procedure
Keep the flame low-medium and put vessel on it.(*Flame should be adjusted according to the thickness of the pan*)  
* Low flame => Thin bottomed pan
* Medium flame => Thick bottomed pan

2. Roast suji in ghee(*Till Suji becomes aromatic or suji turns brown whichever you prefer*). Keep it aside.
3. Now Boil water. Wait till it becomes rolling boiling.
4. Add roasted suji. Mix it well till it is cooked.(*you can think of it like cooking upma*).
5. Then add sugar. Wait till it crystals turned into syrup.
6. Then add salt, ghee, roasted nuts and crushed ilachi. Wait for 1-2 minutes and put off the stove.

## Tips
1. **Roasting Suji or color of final dish**
    * If you want nice brown coloured suji halwa then roast the suji till it turns brown.
    * Add kesar if you want nice red coloured suji halwa.
2. **Sugar Quantity**  
If you are on bit sweeter side then you can add little bit more sugar. I prefer sweets with less sugar.
3. **Milk or water**
    * You can replace water completely with milk.
    * You can replace water partially with milk in the ratio 1:1
    * Using high fat milk enhances the dish even more

### Note:
1. I measured all quantities with respect to amount of suji.
2. I took half glass of suji and added the other quantities based on the quantity of suji.  
This is the proportion I used.  
Suji : water : sugar : ghee :: 1:2:1:1/2  

1cup Suji => 2cups water  
1cup Suji => 1cup sugar  
1cup Suji => 1/2 cup ghee
