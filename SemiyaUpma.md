# Semiya Upma
## Overview
![Semiya Upma](/Images/SemiyaUpma/FinalDish.JPG)  
My mom used to make this Upma which I really like. But sad news is when I ask my mom to do the same Upma, she makes it with different taste and consistency. My mom has little problem with reproducing the same recipes. I like the Upma which is tasty and has texture that is loose like pearls. I don't like mushy or sticky upma. Making semiya upma without stickiness is real challenge and the other challenge is taste.  
I loved this upma very much that this upma made me learn cooking. Yes that's right I started  cooking just to make this upma since my mom is unable to reproduce the taste. After that I slowly started cooking biryani and others.  
During my early cooking days when I was really experimenting to get the tasty semiya upma, I got the tasty upma like my mom made. This is an achievement but the sad news is that till now I am unable to reproduce the same. Even I became an expert in making biryani but still I am unable to reproduce the same tasty semiya upma which I myself has made.  
I have gone through so many websites to get the same taste and consistency with no luck. I learned from one website(*which I don't remember*) to get the texture that I really needed by using water proportionately and using the proper flame, lid and timing after putting off stove. Just to get the texture(*loose grainy without sticking or mushy*) I had to learn so many things. Finally I achieved the texture but taste is really missing. Even though I got the texture, upma tasted like eating boiled semiya sticks. I don't know why it tasted like this. To get rid of this taste, I experimented with ginger, curry leaves, green chillies with different proportions and timing , but still I got the same boiled semiya sticks taste.  

Today I gave a deep thought to my mind remembering the ingredients, taste and texture of my upma that I made earlier in my starting days. I guessed somehow why it got that taste and eureka... I did the upma just following my instincts remembering(*feeling the past*) ingredients and how it's should get cooked. Finally I got the upma which I have been craving for atleast 5 years.

The taste really came from curry leaves, ginger, green chillies and tomato.

## Ingredients 
1. Tadka
    * Oil
    * Ground nut(optional) : 5-10 are sufficient (*Generally is not prefer adding them in semiya upma*)
    * mustard seeds
    * Jeera(optional) : I used very little(*just a pinch*)
    * Black gram(urad dal)
    * Bengal gram(*Chana dal*) : little more(*one handful bite of upma should contain 2-3 chana dal)
    * Green chillies : as per heat(hot) required
    * Curry leaves : 2-3sprigs(*crush them in your hand before adding so that its aromatic juice gets infused into dish*)
3. Semiya(*vermicelli*) : 1-1.25glass or 2.5-3 times my wrist(*I used thick non roasted ones that we usually get from bambino. I don't like the taste of packed vermicelli that is roasted*)
4. Water : 1-1.25glass(*For 1 glass vermicelli, 1 glass water is required on medium(point just about to reach medium) flame*)
5. Ginger : 2-3 times size of tamarind seed(*Crush the ginger(coarse sand like texture) so that its taste really gets infused into upma*)
6. Onion : 1 small (*cut into slices. Adding more onion makes you feel like eating onion instead of upma*)
7. Carrot(optional) : cut into small pieces
8. Tomato : 2-3 medium size(*cut into slices*)

## Procedure
Put on the stove and keep the flame based on the pan so that ingredients do not get burnt.
Thin bottomed pan => low flame(*or just a little above*)  
Thick bottomed pan => medium flame(*or just a little above*)
1. Roast the semiya(*vermicelli*) in oil till it gets brown. And keep it aside. Be aware that semiya gets burnt easily and turns black if not careful while stirring.
2. Add oil. Wait till it gets hot.
3. Add ground nut(optional). Wait till they get 75% cooked.(*Remaining 25% gets cooked after the addition of other ingredients*)
4. Add mustard seeds. Let them sputter.
5. Add cumin(optional). Wait 5 seconds.
6. Add black gram and chana dal. Wait 5-10 seconds
7. Add crushed ginger. Wait 5-10 seconds
8. Add sliced green chillies. Wait 5-10 seconds
9. Add half curry leaves, crushing them a little in your hand by keeping aside the other half for later use. Wait 5-10 seconds
10. Add sliced onions. Wait till they turn transparent. It will take roughly 1-2 minutes.
11. Add Carrot(optional). Wait 1-2 minutes.
12. Add sliced tomatoes and salt(*salt helps in cooking tomato faster*). Wait till they get soft.  It will take roughly 2-3 minutes.
13. Add water. Check the seasoning and salt accordingly. Wait till water gets to rolling boiling.
14. Add the other half curry leaves(crushed in hand). Then again wait till the onions and tomatoes get cooked properly in the boiling water.
15. Add semiya. Wait till it absorbs water completely by stirring it so that it does not stick to bottom.
16. Switch off the stove, put the lid and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before serving.

That's it tasty semiya upma is ready to eat

### Note:
1. **Onion : Tomato**
    * 1:2 or 1:3. I prefer 1:3 since tomatoes give taste and at the same time helps in cutting the taste of boiled vermicelli which is very much required.
    
2. **Reason for adding Curry Leaves in boiling water**
    * Flavour of Curry leaves added during the tadka becomes little mild due to longer cooking times of other ingredients.
    * So to get back the curry leaves flavour punch back into the dish I added curry leaves just before adding semiya or when water gets to rolling boil.
    
    3. **Semiya : Water**
        * Usually 1 : 1 is required
        * Sometimes 1 : 0.75 is required
        Depends on type of vermicelli, pan and flame used.

4. **Why wait even after switching off stove?**
    * By putting the lid on, the steam in the pan helps in giving the loose grainy texture to semiya. I don't know the science behind it, but it happens.
    * If we avoid waiting, there is a high chance that semiya gets mushy.
    
5. **Why crush the ginger to coarse sand like texture?**
    * It helps in coating every grain of semiya grain with ginger.
    * Flavour of ginger is evenly spread across each bite of semiya upma.
