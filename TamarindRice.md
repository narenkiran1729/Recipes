*Final Dish*  

I have learned this from mana chef [Tamarind rice](https://youtu.be/6y_OkUqlDes) 

Spice mix is the one that gives unique taste to pulihora. I have been trying to make pulihora by tempering and to get the taste I needed I change the ingredients in tempering. But changing ingredients in tempering did not give me the taste I really needed.

Today I made pulihora by tempering but added spice mix at the end which changed pulihora taste that I have been trying from very long.

## Ingredients 
1. Spice Mix
    * Dried red chillies : 2-3(depending upon the hotness of chilli you have. More hot chillies => 1 is sufficient 
    * Coriander seeds : 1tbsp
    * Cumin seeds : 1 tbsp(little less than coriander is actually required)
    * Pepper : 1/2 of cumin
    * Fenugreek seeds : 1/2 tsp (adding too much gives bitter taste. According to Vahchef, whenever tamarind is there, then fenugreek seeds should be present)
    * Chana dal : 1-1.5tbsp(little more than coriander seeds is better. It milds the spice mix and makes it palatable. It acts as a base ingredient for gravy.)
    * Sesame seeds : 1tbsp (I added 1/2 tbsp. Most people suggest to use quantity same as chana dal. Vahchef tells that it adds unique taste to the mix, so he adds the powder in tempered tamarind paste.)
    * Black gram(optional) : I did not add this. Try this and let me know how the taste is after adding this. Quantity would be same as chana dal or sesame seeds.
2. Tempering
    * Ground nut
    * Mustard seeds
    * Cumin seeds
    * Black gram
    * Chana dal
    * Dry red chillies
    * Ginger(optional) : According to me ginger is the main ingredient for pulihora. But I made pulihora without ginger, still it is awesome.
    * Green chillies : sliced or chopped whichever you like
    * Curry leaves
    * Turmeric
    * Tamarind : Lemon size (soak and extract slightly thick juice, not too much. Too much thick tamarind does not cook good. Too thin juice makes tempering soaked, wet and soft which I don't like while I am eating. Tempering should be cooked in tamarind juice just enough so that they absorb juices while having little crunch.)
    * Jaggery : little
    * Salt : as required

## Procedure 
1. Cook the rice and keep it aside and let it cool. To get fluffy and tasty rice, add little salt and oil to rice while cooking rice. If you are making large quantity then add turmeric also so that it gets evenly coated and gives nice colour.
2. Dry roast the spice mix. Sesame seeds get burnt so easily, make sure to add them at last. Make it into a fine powder. Keep this spice mix powder aside.
3. Heat the oil. Little more oil is required as the flavours get infused into oil, and this flavoured oil coats the rice distributing the flavour evenly.
    * Add groundnut. Let it cook half.
    * Add mustard, cumin, chana dal, black gram. Wait till mustard sputters.
    * Add dried red chillies. Wait 5-10 seconds.
    * Add ginger(optional). Wait 5-10 seconds.
    * Add green chillies. Wait 5-10 seconds. 
    * Add curry leaves. Wait 5-10 seconds.
    * Add turmeric
    * Add not too thin, not too thick tamarind juice.
    * Add jaggery (optional)
    * Add salt. Wait till oil oozes out of tamarind juice.
    * Add spice mix powder. Wait till the mixture is thick enough for you. Let it cool.
 4. Add the cooled tempered tamarind spice mix mixture to the cooled cooked rice.
 5. That's it tasty tamarind rice is ready to eat.


## Note:
1. **Tempering is not crunchy or tempering does not absorb tamarind flavour.**
When the nuts and tempering are fried and added to the rice, they are crunchy but lacks the tamarind flavour. So to get the tamarind flavour, we cook tamarind juice in the tempering. When tempering is cooked in boiling liquid for long time, tempering gets soft and loses its crunchiness. 
    * To infuse tamarind flavour - we need to cook tamarind juice in tempering.
    * To retain little crunch - we need to cook the tempering in tamarind juice for optimal time.
    * Optimal time because long time makes them soft losing crunchy. Short time does not infuse tamarind juice into the tempering. So there should be a balance while cooking tempering in tamarind juice.
    * Time for cooking tamarind juice depends on the final consistency of mixture after it is cooked. If u add too thin tamarind juice, it takes more time to get the consistency required. If u add too thick tamarind juice, it gives very less time to infuse flavours into tempering. Also sometimes tamarind juice may not be cooked properly.
    * So tamarind juice should not be too thick or too thin. And it should be cooked for optimal time.
