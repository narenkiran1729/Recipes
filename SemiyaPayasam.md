# Semiya Payasam (Kheer)
## Overview
Very easy recipe. Takes little time more than that of making coffee. Runny consistency with right amount of sugar(*more sugar makes you slumber*) and nuts & semiya as required(*not more that it should not feel like eating nuts or semiya only*)

## Ingredients
* 500ml milk - high fat
* Salt - just a pinch
* Sugar - *same as sugar required for two people drinking coffee with 500ml milk*
* Ghee
* Cardamom - 2
* Nuts(optional) - Badam, cashew, pista, kismis
* Thick semiya - *I prefer dry roasting myself - I add very little(1/8th cup for 1cup milk) as I don't like semiya with Upma consistency*

## Procedure
Dry roast semiya and keep it aside.
Once the ghee is hot, add nuts and 1 cardamom. Pour milk, add sugar once the milk is heated a little. Add semiya after milk starts rolling boiling. 
Add another cardamom(crushed or powdered) before putting off stove. 

Please remember that semiya gets cooked even after putting off stove due to the heat from milk.

**Note:**
* When I make semiya upma, I usually add semiya when water comes to rolling boil
* I add half amount of cardamom(out of total quantity) while roasting nuts. I add the other half at the end before putting off stove. 
First half gets mixed and infused into the food(*tastes bland due to over cooking*)while second half makes sure that necessary punch is present while eating.
