Overview
These are all my time tested tips for cooking chicken, mutton and fish.

From now on NonVeg simply means chicken, mutton or fish.

First pre-marination is required for nonveg.

Then pre-marinated nonveg should be slightly fried in oil till meat turns white or when oil is separated. 
Note: Initially during frying, meat releases so much water. Do not panic, its natural. During frying onion chillies can be added, it really depends on how u want ur gravy consistency, doesnâ€™t really changes taste too much.

Now, u can add water(skip this if u want fried nonveg)

after nonveg is cooked till 90-95%, add masala and cook it till raw smell goes off.
Note: Cooking masala too much blands the dish. Its the masala that alters the dish taste entirely. Be careful with masala.


Pre-Marination
lemon juice
ginger garlic paste(optional)- very little
salt



My Masala
For nonveg, i always add ginger garlic paste. Then main flavour ingredient viz. gasagasalu, shah jeera. Sometimes I include onion or cashew or someother in the masala so that i will get some gravy.

Masala 1(To get my moms taste)

Garlic
Gasagasalu
Cumin(optional)

Note: I tested the recipes with various styles and i felt that cumin and cloves add very little flavour, so they are optional.
