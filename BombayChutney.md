# Bombay chutney
## Overview
I learned this recipe from mi chiquita(*who herself had learned this recipe from her father*)

This is hot and spicy version that is generally available in our local tiffin shops in Vizianagaram. It goes really well with tiffin *viz.* dosa(*attu*), idly, wada or my moms pesara punukulu. I usually pour Bombay chutney on top of groundnut chutney while having my tiffin.

Slightly modifying it by adding potato and carrot makes this suitable to eat with poori which I like the most. Again I prefer adding little groundnut chutney as well while I have my pooris.

## Ingredients for 2 persons
1. Besan : *2tbsp*
2. Oil : *1-2 table spoons*
3. Mustard seeds
4. Ginger : *size of tamarind seed*
5. Garlic : *2 pods(small-medium size)*
6. Onion : *half onion(medium size) - adding more onion feels like eating onion while eating chutney which is not nice*
7. Green chillies : *1-2 according to heat required (add little more if more heat is required) - some chillies are not too hot*
8. Tomato (optional) : *1 small size*
9. Curry leaves : *1/2 - 1 sprig*
10. Salt
11. Spice powders
    * Turmeric powder
    * Red chilli powder : 1tbsp *adding too much makes the chutney red which is not good*
    * Garam masala : 1tsp *sprinkle half at the end of recipe*
12. Water : *as required for 2 persons*

## Procedure
1. Add little amount of hot water to besan and make into semi liquid without any solid formations. Keep it aside.
2. Keep flame small-medium and put pan on it. *Adjust the flame according to thickness of pan. Too much heat to cooking ingredients may spoil the dish*  
    * Add oil. Wait till it becomes hot.
    * Then Add mustard seeds. Wait till they start popping.
    * Then Add crushed ginger and garlic. Wait 5-10seconds
    * Add chopped onion. Wait 1 minute.
    * Add sliced green chillies. Wait 5-10 seconds
    * Add chopped tomato(*1tomato cut into 8 pieces*). Wait 1 minute.
    * Add curry leaves (*crush them in your hand before adding so that it's aromatic flavourful liquid oozes out*). Wait 5-10 seconds.
    * Add spice powders viz turmeric, red chilli powder, garam masala. Wait 5-10 seconds. *Please make a note that Spice powders get burnt very easily which makes chutney bitter taste.*
    * Add water.  Add salt to taste. Keep lid to reduce escaping of flavours into air. Once water starts rolling boiling wait for 5-10 min so that onions and tomatoes get cooked well.
    * Add besan paste which is prepared earlier and let it simmer till you get your consistency.
    * Before putting off stove add garam masala(*which gives punch*) and add chopped coriander. Put a lid so that flavours won't escape into air.

That's it spicy Bombay chutney is ready.

## Tips
1. **Adding salt**
    * Add little amount of salt after the addition of each item *viz. onion, tomato* so that it gets cooked faster.
    * Add little less salt if you are going to add coriander. Since coriander has little salt. I learned this from my friend and I have to test this to be sure about it.
  2. **Cooking onions and tomato**
      * onions and tomato should not be fried too much in the oil. These should be cooked in boiling water. So this recipe calls for sweating of onion and tomato in the oil.
  3. **Cooking spice powders**
      * Cooking spice powders is an art. They get burnt very easily. For better results, keep the flame to low before adding the spice powders.
  4. **Adding extra punch at the end**
     * I always add half garam masala during the recipe(*which goes deep into the dish and it's taste becomes bland*) and add the remaining half just before putting off the stove(*which gives required punch*).
