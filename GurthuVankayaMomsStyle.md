# GuttiVankayaMomsStyle
## Overview
This is my mom's recipe. I learnt this recipe from my mom(*she is an excellent cook but sometimes unable to repeat the same taste due to the pressure I put on her.*)  
To learn this recipe from her I had to keep her very calm while she was making the curry and at the same time I had to query her(*if any*) in such a way that her calmness should not be disturbed.

With its thick gravy texture, tangy and spicy flavours on the tongue makes this curry more mouth watering(*that I lick the curry so much that my plate looks very clean*)

**I think I don't need to mention to you how much I love this curry**

**Ingredients Card**

1. Brinjals
2. Oil - *This curry requires 3-4 times more oil than usual curry*
3. 1-2 Bayleaf
4.  **Masala - To grind**
    * 3-4 Medium sized onions
    * 1 small tomato
    * Ginger
    * Garlic
    * 2 Chillies
    * 4-5 Cloves
    * 1 inch cinnamon
    * 1 Cardamom
    * Coriander seeds
    * Gasa Gasalu - poppy seeds
    * 4-5 Pepper seeds
5. Salt
6. Red chilli powder
7. Tamarind - *thick tamarind juice is required*

## Procedure
Grind the masala and keep the paste aside.  

Add some salt to water and then chop brinjals in gutti vankaya style. Adding chopped brinjals to salt water reduces the color damage to brinjal.  
Deep fry the chopped brinjal till soft and keep aside.

Now add oil and add 1-2bayleaf after oil is hot.

Then add the grinded paste and cook till oil oozes out. Adding salt helps in cooking grinded paste faster.
Then add red chilli powder and salt if necessary. Cook till oil oozes out.   
Then add fried brinjals and cook.  

After 5 minutes, add thick tamarind juice(with less water) to get tangy taste. Cook till oil oozes out.

Thats it.

Excellent Mom's style Gutti Vankaya curry ready.
