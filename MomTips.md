# Mom Tips
# Cooking mutton
Heat oil, add green chillies and onions. After they are cooked add mutton. Add water accordingly. Wait till it gets cooked. At the end of recipe add the masala.  
According to my mom the masala taste required for mutton mainly is due to gasagasalu and Jeera.

### Masala
Ginger
Garlic
Jeera(cumin)
Gasagasalu
Cloves
Onion - 1/2 or 1 (*just to make sure so that masala will be grinded in mixer*)

1. If you are planning to cook chana dal mutton or potato mutton, do not add onion in the grinded masala. Because of onion or chana dal, onion present in paste smells bad according to my mom. Since onion is not added, masala needs to be grinded in ding chik by hand(mixer cannot be used)
2. Mutton : potato or chana dal :: 1 : 1/4  
Adding too much potato takes away mutton flavour and feels like eating potato instead of mutton curry.  
Chana dal quantity is after it is cooked, that means raw chana dal should be taken less than 1/4 so that it will become 1/4 after it gets cooked.

# Cooking Tomato Dal
Adding salt or tomato or tamarind makes dal not to cook.
Cook the dal in plain water, once it is cooked add chopped tomato. Once tomato is cooked, add salt,green chillies or red chilli powder,turmeric. Now add very little thick tamarind water.
Adding tamarind(not too much) gives little extra punch to dal according to my mom. Consistency of dish should be thick and it should be runny according to my mom.
At last as usual tadka goes on.

# Cooking tadka dal
This recipe is only for moong dal.  
Heat oil and add  
* Tadka(mustard, cumin, curry leaves, red chillies, garlic)  
* Green chillies
* Chopped onions

Wait till dal gets cooked.  
Adding tomato in this recipe is not good according to my mom.
