# Fried Rice
## Overview
This is my self styled egg fried rice which tastes like *Paradise Restaurant's* Egg Fried Rice.  

**Note:** This recipe is inspired from [Egg Fried Rice by Vismai Food](https://youtu.be/jEQfy9QeJEU)

## Ingredients
1. Oil _(prefarably Palm oil)_
2. Eggs - Add salt, pepper and beat the eggs
3. **Veggies**
    * Carrot
    * French beans
    * Capsicum  
    *Note:* Carrot : French beans : Capsicum = 1 : 1 : 0.5
4. Rice _(prefarably Basmati Rice)_ _(Cook till 80-90%)_
4. **Spice Powders**
    * Black pepper
    * White pepper
5. Soya Sauce _(Use light soya sauce, if u want white colored fried rice)_
6. Chilli Vinegar _(If u smell this, you will get 50% smell of paradise fried rice)_
7. Sugar
8. Salt
9. Ajinomoto
10. Spring onions _(optional)_ _(I never saw these in paradise fried rice)_

### Procedure
1. Heat oil in pan and when it is hot,  add beaten egg.  
    **Note:**
    *Egg puffs up around the edges. Remove the puffed edges carefully without disturbing the inside. Now, again egg puffs up around the edges. Again remove the puffed edges carefully. Do this until all the egg is puffed up completely.*
2. Now add Veggies. Turn the flame to high. Wait till 50-70% is cooked.  
    **Note:**
    *All chinese food needs to be cooked in high flame*
3. Add rice and mix well. Listen to the sound when rice is fried.
4. Add Soya Sauce, Chilli Vinegar, Salt, Sugar, Ajinomoto, Pepper(both black and white) and mix well.
5. Add Spring onions just before turning off stove

### Observations
Paradise fried rice taste comes mostly from chilli vinegar and pepper powder as far as I understood. Remaining taste comes from cooking style.
