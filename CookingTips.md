# Tips for Cooking Chicken
1. Marinate the chicken with curd(*lemon juice*), turmeric and little salt for 30-60minutes(*or refrigerate it for 6-12hours*)
    * Turmeric - reduces bacteria growth that spoils chicken
    * Little salt - chicken absorbs this salt by some kind of chemical process which makes chicken even tastier.(*Adding too much salt makes chicken not to ooze out moisture while cooking making chicken dry which is not required*)
    * Curd(*or lemon juice*) - Acid cooks the chicken and makes it even softer.
###     Note : 
Adding curd in any recipe reduces its spice and hot(*heat*) which makes curry mild(*less intense*). Make sure to add spices and hot(*heat*) little extra if you are adding curd.
    
2. Wait till the chicken comes to room temperature before cooking. Adding cold chicken directly to hot vessel toughens the chicken which is not required.

3. Stew(simmer it in masala water) the chicken so that collagen in bones is converted into gelatinous liquid which makes the chicken tender juicy and gravy tasty.
    * Prefer thigh chicken for stewing as it has more collagen compared to breast meat.
    * Breast piece cooks faster due to lack of collagen. Overcooking breast pieces(*makes pieces hard and rubbery*) is dangerous thing that needs to be avoided by being extra careful by keeping the flame to low.
    
4. Add the chicken only after the onions turn transparent and starting into golden brown. These onions will turn into gravy in the final dish.

5. Adding cold water to the chicken toughens it. So add hot boiling water(*if water is required as per recipe*)

6. Tomatoes(*which I usually avoid while making chicken*)make chicken rubbery if not followed cooking principles properly. Also some tomatoes are sour and some are sweet.
    * Add the chicken when the tomato(*Slices*) has cooked properly oozing out its oil.
    * Or Add the chicken and wait till it's half cooked oozing out it's moisture, then add the tomato purée. At this point tomatoes don't have much time to cook so I am adding purée instead of slices.

7. Keep little masala aside to add it later just before putting off stove. This makes sure to bring back the essential masala punch that is carried away by steam due to longer duration of cooking. Before keeping Masala aside for bringing back punch, makes sure it is cooked if it needs to be cooked to get off its raw flavours.
    * For masalas that require sautéing or light frying(*to avoid the raw flavours*), keep some masala aside after sautéing or frying.  
    Eg: Ginger garlic paste, onion ginger garlic paste, green chilli coriander ginger garlic paste etc.  
Ginger garlic paste needs to be cooked in fats like oil(*not in liquids like water*) so as to avoid its raw flavour.  
Adding masalas(*that need to be cooked in oil*) at the end to bring back the punch makes the curry even worse if it is not cooked in oil.
