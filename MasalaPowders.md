# Masala Powders
## Overview
Here I am going to place the masala powders which I had learnt. Because this is where lot of confusion(*confusion means which spice needs to be mixed in which masala*) is going to take place, I am going to place all powders in one place so that confusion will be eliminated.

Currently the following masala powders are available. I will try to update the other powders as soon as I learn them.

1. Garam Masala
2. Biryani Masala

# Garam Masala
## Overview
This masala powder is used in almost all places viz. curries, fries, chutneys like Bombay chutney.   
I learnt this from YouTube channel [Amma Chethi Vanta](https://youtu.be/PCfUOUas3-4)
I think garam masala is very much an essential requirement for almost all spicy curries.  
I don't like to purchase these packed powders from shops as I don't believe in them.

## Procedure
Sun dry for 1 hour and make into fine powder

### Note
1. Garam masala does not include coriander powder and jeers powder. Add them separately if required for recipe. (*Do not skip adding coriander powder or jeera powder thinking that they are present in garam masala powder*)
2. **Sun dry vs Dry roast**
    * Dry roasting changes the flavour a bit(*due to chemical reactions in presence of heat*). You can experiment with dry roasting and check if that flavour suits you. Personally, I don't like the dry roast flavour so I prefer sun drying for GaramMasala and BiryaniMasala.

# Biryani Masala
## Overview
I use this Biryani Masala not only for chicken biryani but also for my own egg biryani recipe(*I am unable to find egg biryani online which suits my taste , so I had to invent my own*)  
I will try the same biryani masala for preparing Veg biryani and will update you soon.
