# Masala Powders
## Overview
Here I am going to place the masala powders which I had learnt. Because this is where lot of confusion(*confusion means which spice needs to be mixed in which masala*) is going to take place, I am going to place all powders in one place so that confusion will be eliminated.

Currently the following masala powders are available. I will try to update the other powders as soon as I learn them.

1. Garam Masala
2. Biryani Masala
3. Kadai Chicken Masala
4. Chettinad Chicken Masala

# Garam Masala
The source ammachethivanta I used did not added the cumin which is necessary ingredient for garam masala. Below garam masala which I made is like biryani masala. So I will update the garam masala with jeera and sometimes pepper using [AttammaTV](https://youtu.be/XGL_RYujQ_o) 
## Overview
This masala powder is used in almost all places viz. curries, fries, chutneys like Bombay chutney.   
I learnt this from YouTube channel [Amma Chethi Vanta](https://youtu.be/PCfUOUas3-4)
I think garam masala is very much an essential requirement for almost all spicy curries.  
I don't like to purchase these packed powders from shops as I don't believe in them.

## Procedure
Sun dry for 1 hour and make into fine powder

### Note
1. Garam masala does not include coriander powder and jeers powder. Add them separately if required for recipe. (*Do not skip adding coriander powder or jeera powder thinking that they are present in garam masala powder*)
2. **Sun dry vs Dry roast**
    * Dry roasting changes the flavour a bit(*due to chemical reactions in presence of heat*). You can experiment with dry roasting and check if that flavour suits you. Personally, I don't like the dry roast flavour so I prefer sun drying for GaramMasala and BiryaniMasala.

# Biryani Masala
## Overview
I use this Biryani Masala not only for chicken biryani but also for my own egg biryani recipe(*I am unable to find egg biryani online which suits my taste , so I had to invent my own*)  
I will try the same biryani masala for preparing Veg biryani and will update you soon.

## Procedure

# Kadai Chicken Masala
## Overview
You can also use this masala for veg curries like Kadai paneer. This masala is used in making Kadai Chicken Masala. I heard that the taste of Kadai Chicken Masala is due to Red chillies, Coriander powder and Fennel Seeds but I have to experiment the same. Without experimenting I understood that jeera and black pepper are added to increase the spice further up.   
To get the smoky flavour(that you get in restaurants) in the curry, slightly heat the diced onions and capsicum in oil and smoke it using charcoal. Throw these smoke flavoured diced onions and capsicum into the recipe at(*or near*) the end of recipe.
### Note:
1. Remember that adding jeera and pepper corns is not the same. 
### Adding Jeera
    * Increases heat(hot)
    * Changes flavour substantially
### Adding Pepper Corns
    * Increases heat(hot) 
    * Changes the flavour very less(*very very less compared to Jeera*)

## Ingredients:
1. Red Chillies
2. Coriander seeds
3. Fennel Seeds(*Saunf*)
4. Jeera(*Cumin*)
5. Black pepper corns

## Procedure
Dry roast the ingredients and grind them.  
Use half(if possible fine powder) during the curry and the other half(*if possible coarse powder*) at(or near) the end of recipe.

# Chettinad Chicken Masala
## Overview
This masala is used while making the famous chettinad chicken masala curry. This masala should be freshly prepared for the curry. This freshness gives super taste to the dish.  
I think that this masala is special variant of garam masala(*which generally(but not always) includes jeera,coriander and pepper*) where in spices(cloves, cinnamon, cardamom) are reduced in quantity while slightly increasing the spices(Jeera and pepper)

The ingredients are same as kadai chicken with the addition of coconut and other spices viz. Cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, star anise. Some people also add black stone flower, mace(*javitri or japatri*)

## Ingredients
1. Red chillies : 6 (change it according to heat required.) Red chillies I used are from dmart which are little less spicier.
2. Coriander seeds : 3 spoons
3. Cumin(*Jeera*) : 1 spoon
4. Fennel seeds(*Soanf*) : 1 spoon(*or little less than cumin*)
5. Black pepper corns : 1spoon(*or little less than cumin*)  
*All the above five ingredients constitute kadai masala.*
6. Coconut(*freshly grated or store bought desiccated*) : 1/2cup or 1cup (*For exact quantity think of the gravy or texture you would like to have in the dish*)
7. Cloves : 4-5
8. Cardamom : 2-3
9. Cinnamon : 1inch
10. Star anise : 1/2 or 1
11. Mace(*optional*) : 1/4 or 1/2(*If I have to add, then I prefer adding less since it gives me a hint of biryani flavour which I don't like in chettinad chicken dish)
12. Black stone flower(*optional*)
13. Bay leaf(*optional*) : 1-2 (*I personally don't like to add this in masala since we have to eat if it is grinded. But I prefer adding in hot oil while preparing the curry so that it need not be grinded and it can easily be taken away while eating the curry*)

## Procedure
Use thick botommed pan and use low flame.
1. Dry roast the spices without coconut till they are fragrant. Keep it aside.
2. Dry roast the coconut till it gets brown coloured. Now add the roasted spices to this coconut and roast for 2-3min. 
3. Switch off the stove, cool it and then make into fine powder.

That's it tasty chettinad chicken masala is ready.

Add this powder once the onions and tomatoes(*that are called for in the recipe*) are cooked well. Add this before the addition of marinated chicken(*little salt, turmeric, curd*). You can also experiment by adding this masala after the chicken is slightly cooked.  
Always remember to keep some masala aside(*to add at or near the end of dish*), since cooking for long times(*sometimes it is required for chicken cooking in low flame*) makes the curry bland due to Steam carrying away the flavours and other chemical reactions which I don't know.
